Firebase activities that i use and learn :


1. Firebase Authentication 

Most apps need to know the identity of a user. Knowing a user's identity allows an app to securely save user data in the cloud and provide the same personalized experience across all of the user's devices.

2. Firebase Firestore

Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud. Like Firebase Realtime Database, it keeps your data in sync across client apps through realtime listeners and offers offline support for mobile and web so you can build responsive apps that work regardless of network latency or Internet connectivity. Cloud Firestore also offers seamless integration with other Firebase and Google Cloud products, including Cloud Functions.

3. Firebase Storage

Cloud Storage for Firebase is built for app developers who need to store and serve user-generated content, such as photos or videos.Cloud Storage for Firebase is a powerful, simple, and cost-effective object storage service built for Google scale. The Firebase SDKs for Cloud Storage add Google security to file uploads and downloads for your Firebase apps, regardless of network quality.

Images add much-needed context and visual flair to Android applications. Picasso allows for hassle-free image loading in your applicationâ€”often in one line of code!

Picasso.get().load("https://i.imgur.com/DvpvklR.png").into(imageView);

Many common pitfalls of image loading on Android are handled automatically by Picasso:

- Handling ImageView recycling and download cancelation in an adapter.

- Complex image transformations with minimal memory use.

- Automatic memory and disk caching.
